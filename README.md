## Extending to Other Universities
This project is designed with extensibility in mind and can be adapted to work with other university portals. To extend the code for your university:

- Create a New University Class
- Inherit from the base scraper class
- create new classes for your finals and classes with whatever variables you want
- Implement schedule extraction method specific to your university's portal

Example structure for adding a new university:
```python
class NewUniversityScraper(CalendarScraper):
    def get_events(self) -> list[CalendarEvent]:
        # Implement schedule extraction for your university
        pass


class NewUniversityClass(CalendarEvent):
    def make_event(self) -> Event:
        # Implement how you want the event to appear in the calendar
        pass

class NewUniversityFinal(CalendarEvent):
    def make_event(self) -> Event:
        # Implement how you want the event to appear in the calendar
        pass
```

If you successfully extend this project to another university, consider contributing back to help other students!
